>>> The option values are suggested.

Warning: Cell contains tie connections which are not connected to real PG. (ZRT-511)
Warning: Ignore contact DIFFCON. (ZRT-015)
Cell Min-Routing-Layer = M1
Cell Max-Routing-Layer = M9
Turn off antenna since no rule is specified
Information: Option route.detail.force_end_on_preferred_grid will be ignored since none of the layers have preferred grid. (ZRT-703)
Warning: Port GVDD of cell routing
        is unplaced.  This may impact routing result. (ZRT-740)
Warning: Port GVSS of cell routing
        is unplaced.  This may impact routing result. (ZRT-740)
Warning: Ignore 2 top cell ports with no pins. (ZRT-027)
Info: number of net_type_blockage: 0 
Information: Via ladder engine would be activated for pattern must join connection in certain commands. Please refer to man-page for the command list. (ZRT-619)
Via on layer (VIA1) needs more than one tracks
Warning: Layer M1 default pitch 0.320 may be too small to handle up/down via. Note, that minimum requirements are "wire/via-down 0.315" & "wire/via-up 0.330". (ZRT-026)
Via on layer (VIA1) needs more than one tracks
Warning: Layer M2 default pitch 0.320 may be too small to handle up/down via. Note, that minimum requirements are "wire/via-down 0.360" & "wire/via-up 0.320". (ZRT-026)
Information: When applicable Min-max layer allow_pin_connection mode will allow paths of length 7.50 outside the layer range. (ZRT-707)
Information: When applicable Min-max layer allow_pin_connection mode will allow paths of length 7.50 outside the layer range on clock nets. (ZRT-718)
Information: When applicable layer based tapering will taper up to 0.00 in distance from the pin. (ZRT-706)
